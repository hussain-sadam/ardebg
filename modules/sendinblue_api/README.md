## INTRODUCTION

This module uses
[v3](https://developers.sendinblue.com) of
the Sendinblue API API.
It allows users to add an API key and secret generated by a Sendinblue account in the settings.php file (or via an admin UI). Then will allow users to activate/enable a list and create a block derivative for each list that is enabled. It also provides an optional REST endpoint to send signups to the CC API for enabled lists.
